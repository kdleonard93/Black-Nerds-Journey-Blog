## Day 6: Python Functions & Karel

## Today's Lesson
This article should be short and sweet. There weren't any assignments for this day so It didn't take me as long as the previous days.

We pretty much just discussed functions and while loops as well as touched on the importance of indentation.

While loops in Python are still a bit confusing for me so I won't go into detail or try to explain the concept like It clicked for me the first time through. For the day's project, we used [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) for the challenge. The objective was to lead him to the finish by using while loops and if statements. My solution is below.

##EOD
Like I said, today was pretty short and sweet. I'll probably have to go over this lesson again or see if my other course can explain this concept in more detail for me.

See ya tomorrow ✌🏾.

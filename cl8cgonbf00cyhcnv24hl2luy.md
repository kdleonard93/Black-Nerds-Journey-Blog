## Day 13: Debugging - How To Find and Fix Errors in Your Code

## Today's Lesson
This write-up is going to be VERY short. Just want to note some of the tips and tools Angela mentioned.

#### General Tips

There were a few general tips she mentioned that always come in handy when debugging:

<ul>
<li>Descripe the problem</li>
<li>Reproduce the bug</li>
<li>Evaluate each line</li>
<li>Utilize print()....a lot lol</li>
<li>Using an actual Debugger</li>
</ul>

I won't go into the details of each but I have some other resources bookmarked if needed.

#### The Debugger
The Debuggers she recommended were Thony (desktop app) and Python Tutor (https://pythontutor.com/). I downloaded Thony but didn't seem to be working for me (most likely not doing something correct on my end) so I used PT. Also, PT shows a visualization along with the step-by-step of the program.

## EOD
Like I said, very short write up but I did learn a few good tips for debugging.

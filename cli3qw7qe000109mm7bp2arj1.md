## Today's Lesson

So for Day 18, I'm going to split this up between 2 days since she has 5 challenges in this section as well as a project. Today I'm just going to work on the challenges and tomorrow I'll run through the project and what we focused on for that project.

## 5 Turtle Challenges

So there are five different lectures with five challenges:  
1\. Draw a Square  
2\. Draw a Dashed Line  
3\. Draw Different Shapes  
4\. Generate a Random Walk  
5\. Draw a Spirograph

I don't feel the need to add any snippets of code from the challenges so this is more so a recap for me to double back to. A new concept we touch on is `Tuples`. They are immutable, ordered collections of items in a single variable. Their immutability and ability to hold heterogeneous data distinguish them from lists.

## EOD

Today's reading is very short. I'll go into more detail on the project with snippets and whatnot. üòÅ

## Day 1: Python Object and Data Structure Basics

## I wanted to give a quick run down on how I'll be splitting up my daily blog

In the first portion, I'll go over what I learned from the 2022 Complete Bootcamp course. I'll mainly touch base on the core concepts of the section and what I learned (or struggled learning). The second portion of the blog will be dedicated to the project I completed in the sections of 100 Days of Code: Python course. This one should be short considering its just the basics.

### Numbers, Variables, and Strings

The first couple of lessons should not come as a surprise to anyone privy to development in any language. I was able to pick these concepts up easily due to the fact the syntax is very strait-forward and was easily adaptable from knowing primitive types in JS. One thing that I noticed that was different off the bat was `print()` vs `console.log()`. They pretty much produce the same result but just typed differently. Another difference between JS and Python I noticed was the naming convention for Objects and Arrays. In Python, they are called `Dictionaries/Lists` and `Sets`, respectively. If I'm missing any other key differences that would be good to note, let me know in the comments! Most of everything else functions the same way in terms of strings and assigning variables. In the lesson, they touch base on Booleans and File I/O but since the 100 Days of code project for Day 1 only covers String and Variables, I'll save my learnings on that for another day (most likely tomorrow üòÑ).

### 100 Days of Code Project: Day 1 - Band Name Generator

Alright, so this project was pretty simple. It's basically just `print()` statements and `input()` statements with variables. The objective was to ask a couple questions and have the result concatenate the two answers in a `print` call. The code i did to complete this is below:
```
print("Welcome to the band name generator")
input("Which City Did You Grow Up In?")
city = input("Which City Did You Grow Up In?\n")
pet = input("What Is Your Pet's Name?\n")
print("your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
```
I will say if I were to do this in JS, there would be a bit more syntax needed. Other than that, I think Day 1's project was pretty straight forward and simple.

### EOD
That about wraps it up for Day 1. If anyone has taken these course and have notes or if anyone just wants to chime in, please do as I am open to any helpful corrections, tips, and lessons üòÅ.
